Former President Jimmy Carter has announced this year that he is cancer free. After being diagnosed of stage IV melanoma last year, it was surprising to many with this miraculous news. While the early stages of melanoma (which has not spread to other parts of the body) are easily curable, stage IV melanoma (which has spread to other vital organs) was thought of as a death sentence even several years ago. So this makes us wonder, how did the former president become free of melanoma?

The answer lies in the unbelievable advancement in melanoma treatment in the past five years. First of all, what is melanoma? Melanoma is the deadliest type of skin cancer that develops from melanocyte, a melanin producing cell. While melanoma accounts for less than five percent of skin cancer cases, melanoma has been at the center of therapy development. Two types of therapies, immunotherapy and targeted therapy, have together revolutionized melanoma treatment. Since 2011, the FDA has approved 8 new drugs for the treatment of melanoma – four immunotherapies and four targeted therapies.

Today, one of the frontline treatment for melanoma is anti-PD1 therapy. This drug is a newly developed immunotherapy that molecularly targets PD-1 receptors. The receptors are located on lymphocytes and are responsible for inhibiting the immune response to cancer cells which express PD-L1. When PD-L1 binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signal is produced and reduces the proliferation of CD8+ T cells. In normal body function, this complex immune checkpoint system is in place to prevent autoimmune diseases and excessive reaction to infections. PD-L1 is usually only expressed in immune cells, and it is epigenetically inhibited other cell types. However, in melanoma patients, tumor cells successfully make epigenetic changes to allow for PD-L1 expression, which turns on the “brake” of the immune response. Anti-PD1 therapy selectively targets the PD-1 receptors which then disables the immune suppressing potential of tumor cells. In short, the goal of the drug is to reinvigorate the immune system, allowing it to target and destroy cancer cells.

Another type of newly developed therapy is targeted therapy, most notably known for BRAF and MEK inhibitor. BRAF is a mitogen activated kinase that is part of the MAPK pathway, which controls proliferation, growth, and survival. The BRAF mutation causes cells to grow and proliferate uncontrollably, and is suspected to be the main oncogene that causes melanoma.  About 50% of melanoma patients have BRAF mutation, and BRAF inhibitors showed great success in clinical trials. Soon after, the MEK inhibitor, which targets the downstream signal transduction molecule of MAPK pathway, was combined with BRAF inhibitor in a clinical trial. While BRAF and MEK inhibitors were developed separately, when the two drugs were combined, something remarkable occurred. The combination therapy turned out to be more effective as well as less likely to cause toxicity than when each drug was used separately. This result was hard to believe as the biggest and most common problem of combination therapies is that toxicity becomes too great for patients to tolerate. Now, the combination therapy of BRAF and MEK inhibitors became one of the frontline treatment for patients with BRAF mutation and shows some kind of positive response in 100% of those patients.

The future direction of research in the melanoma treatment is finding ways to combine different drugs and creating new drugs that could inhibit other mutated pathways. While immunotherapy and targeted therapy are most successful in melanoma, scientists and doctors are hoping to generate similar efficacy in other cancer types. With such an incredible progress that the melanoma field has made in the past several years, we now feel much closer to finding a cure for cancer.
