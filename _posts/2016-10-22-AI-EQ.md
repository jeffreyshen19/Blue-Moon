When you think of “artificial intelligence,” the image that appears in your head is most likely that of a humanoid robot like Ava. However, artificial intelligence varies in complexity from comparatively simple voice recognition, to full-on humans, though we aren’t quite there yet. Last year, AI hit several milestones, including an area called deep learning. Deep learning is a system that uses data and computational skills to learn what objects are and how to distinguish them. Commercially, machine learning is being used in technology for autonomous cars as well as high-range cameras that capture images surpassing human perception.
<br>
<br>
However, the real question is: how far away is The Singularity?
<br>
<br>
In The Age of Intelligent Machines, Ray Kurzweil predicted that true artificial intelligence, or artificial consciousness, will exist in 2019. His prediction implies that computing power will equal the total brainpower of humans, but this doesn’t mean the year of 2019 will mark the year of The Singularity. Rather, Kurzweil predicts that in 2045, AI will be the most intelligent beings on Earth.
<br>
<br>
The major problem we see with Kurzweil assumption is: Can a machine really be human if it has no emotions? This leads to the question of what is a real emotion? In Ex Machina, Ava,  begins to display humanistic qualities such as sexuality, seduction, and manipulation. Some could argue that because these qualities come with a range of emotional responses, Ava was displaying emotion. Not only was she able to convey her emotions, but even Caleb could not distinguish the difference between her emotional responses and that of a human’s. However, at the end of the movie, it is clear that her superior intelligence outweighs her seemingly emotional behavior, when she betrays Caleb.
<br>
<br>
Movies aside, can AI in real life actually display human emotions? In 2014, Aldebaran released Pepper, a robot that reads humans’ emotions and tailors a conversation with that person based on how they are feeling. Studies show that mirroring behavior, when holding a conversation, can form a bond between people. As we see in Pepper, as well as in Ex Machina, emotions can result from this mirroring of behavior.  While you could argue that a robot has no emotions, period, it is still dangerous to create machines that can alter human emotions.
<br>
<br>
My question is: Can we really begin to fathom programming emotions if we haven’t even fully understood emotional responses in humans? Sure, we can program a robot with a simple “emotion” that reacts in certain ways when it is feeling a certain way, but we unanimously agree that emotions are complex and multifaceted. Could a computer really hold all this complexity? Storage-wise, perhaps, but how can we predict how a machine will act under the influence of a strong emotion, if we can’t even understand how a person will react? I am going to leave these questions unanswered so you can think about this as well: What makes a human human? And if the answer is “emotion,” then is an emotion really programmable?
