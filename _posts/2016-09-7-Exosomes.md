Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (40-100nm) that most cells release into their surroundings. They contain functional biomolecules, such as protein, mRNA, microRNA, and surprisingly even dsDNA, that can be horizontally transferred to recipient cells. This quality made scientists to believe that exosomes might play a major role in cancer metasisis. Also, it was observed that cancer patients have significantly higher numbers of exosomes circulating in their blood stream, also suggesting that exosomes could be contributing to pro-metasizing phenotype. Using these properties, scientists are aiming to use exosomes towards cancer detection and treatment.

First, exosomes have diagnostic and prognostic value. Exosome isolation and analysis, which is done with a small sample of the patient’s plasma or serum, are much safer than solid biopsy, which physically retrieves part of the tumor with a needle. For diagnostic purposes, we can use exosomes to detect oncoprotein or primary mutation (such as BRAF mutation which is present in nearly 50% of melanoma patients) from the patient’s blood. By knowing the initial mutation of the tumor, we can treat the patient with appropriate drugs. Exosomes can be also used for prognosis and drug choices according to it. Most tumors, when treated, will eventually gain resistance to the drug due to selective pressure for certain mutations. Because physicians cannot monitor mutations in tumor cites without taking a biopsy, the prediction of resistance cannot be made. Thus, it is difficult for doctors to decide when to switch to a different drug to effectively suppress tumor growth. By analyzing exosomes regularly, we can detect mutations before the tumor cites show resistance, and plan treatment accordingly. If diagnostic and prognostic potential of exosome is reached, doctors can make better decisions in prescribing more personal and more effective drugs for individual patients.

Although there are other methods of blood based biopsy such as detecting circulating tumor cells or cell free DNA, there has been strong evidence that using exosome has more benefits. Below is a table comparing CTC, cfDNA, and exosome.

Another potential use of exosome is drug delivery. Although this process is at a very introductory stage, many scientists hope to use the basic properties of exosomes, in which they horizontally transfer information, to deliver drugs to the cancer cells. To make exosomes to target only the cancer cells, scientists have been modifying surface proteins with targeting ligands. Although modifying and creating effective exosomes in vitro have many difficulties, if the drugs can be delivered through exosome, it can generate greater specificity and less toxicity for patients. Overall, while research in exosome still has a long way to go until it can be useful for patients, it has great potential uses and promising future.
