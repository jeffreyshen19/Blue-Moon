Date of interview: July 14, 2016  
Title of person being interviewed: Associate professor in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCLA  
Education background: Bachelors in physics and chemistry at Queen’s University, Masters in Physics at University of British Columbia, PhD in biophysics at UC Berkeley
<br>
<br>
Dr. Lloyd Smith majored in physics and chemistry as an undergrad. From there, he moved onto a masters degree in physics, while also developing a passion for biology. He then became interested in biophysics and did his PhD at UC Berkeley on biophysics. From there, he became interested in population ecology and using computers to model population dynamics. Dr. Lloyd Smith then jumped into computation analysis on how diseases spread.
