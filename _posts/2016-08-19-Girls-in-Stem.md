In thirty-five years, only three of the 224 USA national team members sent to the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) have been female. That’s equivalent to 1.3 percent. You might ask why this astounding gender gap exists in the realm of high level mathematics - I most certainly hope that you do. But, in the frank words of IMO gold medalist Evan Chen, we’ve got pretty much “no clue whatsoever.” 
So, instead, this article is going to be about the hugely important resultant topic: how this deplorable imbalance has impacted the self-worth and achievements of many young women today and what that in turn has done to the STEM community.

As said above, high level science is absolutely male dominated. Many institutions have tried to remedy this; for example, MIT Primes, a competitive research opportunity for high school students, specifically urges females to apply. However, despite the best intentions of these programs, one pretty devastating consequence of this increased desire for female participants is that many people assume accepted females aren’t nearly as qualified as their male peers.

A female PA student who wishes to remain unnamed recently attended a prestigious STEM summer program. When she placed first on a camp-wide assessment, the counselors so strongly doubted her ability that some wished to reweight the data to create a different winner. Many males at her same demonstrated level of accomplishment had also finished in top spots, and yet no authorities questioned any of their results. Commenting on this, she said, “They thought think I got in to fill quotas and not on my brains.”

Although this young woman thankfully and admirably “still absolutely [wants] to get a PHD and become a professor one day,” it’s pretty clear that this level of sexism deters many girls from STEM. Dr. Jeremy Copeland, acclaimed instructor and administrator at the online mathematical academy Art of Problem Solving, explained that some women at UChicago, where he attended, “felt frustrated by others assuming they’re not qualified.” Furthermore, Evan Chen commented that one factor into high level competition-math performance is “whether you signed up” or not. Though this may seem self evident, it’s pretty easy to see the consequences on the gender gap. Doubted and disrespected women are more likely to pursue other, non-STEM paths; this then reinforces the stereotype that women are less good at STEM and therefore that those actually in the field are only there to fill quotas. Thus the vicious cycle perpetuates itself.

But there is hope. According to Dr. Copeland, research has shown that women might be more successful in environments that are “collaborative and less combative.” In this vein, there are now all-female competitions at the highest levels which stress comradery and team-work among the participants; Math Prize for Girls actually hosts a game night where girls work together on solving puzzles. And we can see this at play in our very own Andover community; Michael Ren 18’ describes STEM classes as “discussion based, with everyone’s contributions providing meaningful progress. Everyone trusts each other, and never is the ability of any girl doubted.”
