A bespectacled man sits at a tidy lab bench primed for cutting edge research at the Condensed Matter Physics Center at the University of Manchester, ardently focusing on material on the sticky verge of translucence in his hands. With no extraordinary sense of grace or deliberate training, the man is putting into practice the technique that earned him the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics: sticking and unsticking scotch tape.

Picture this: a material that is harder than diamond, lighter than anything imaginable, and faster at conducting electricity than material in most semiconductors.This is the power of two dimensional, thin layer graphene. Two dimensional physics is complex and strange in the theoretical realm, but comes across as a bit underwhelming in practice. The Scotch Tape Method (perhaps more scientifically called ‘micromechanical exfoliation’) was developed in a playful, innovative approach to physics by aforementioned Andre Geim as a way to extract thin one or two layer sheets of material only atomically thick in depth. The method involves placing a bulk crystal of some kind of interesting material like graphene and silicene onto a piece of scotch tape and sticking the ends together until the crystal is in thin, small quantities. But how do you know if you have a scientifically useful quality thin layer? By placing the sample under the optical microscope and looking for samples that appear blueish at higher magnifications (and later checking this under an atomic force microscope).

The van der Waals-bonded sheet of graphene can then be fabricated into devices for solar cells, useful for additive manufacturing techniques for lighter, stronger fabrics, and created into energy storage devices with super-fast charging times. There is a certain beauty to the simplicity: a way that materials with such range and capacity can be extracted using a technique no more complex than that found in a kindergarten classroom. In fact, Andre Geim, the credited creator of the expanding frontier in two dimensional engineering, can trace the origins of his most impactful contribution to what he calls “Friday Night Experiments”. In bouts of playful researching (other experiments have included levitating the family hamster), he found what many other physicists had been missing for years: instead of using thousands of dollars worth of complex nanotechnological equipment, thin materials could be created using the very tape that the materials were stored next to. Across disciplines, another great researcher, Edward O. Wilson, a leading American sociobiologist, too, claims that some of his most profound discoveries were the results of “short, imperfect experiments” where he would “just try things out”.

From engineering the most profound breakthroughs in two dimensional materials, to any sort of STEM endeavor one thing is clear: good, world-changing science does not require complexity and the best work is often the simplest. Off-the-cuff science: careless, yet elegant, the epitome of intellectual serendipity. Nobel-level science accessible to a toddler. Want to create the next big breakthrough? Perhaps a good place to start is to get in touch with your playful side.
