Vroom, vroom! The cars rev up and begin the race, racing along the gold floor. in Toulouse, France in 2017. At subzero temperatures of -268oC, surrounded in an ultra-high vacuum, these cars are more than special—they’re nanocars. Powered by molecular “engines”, nanocars represent more than 30 years of efforts creating molecular machines, by Jean-Pierre Sauvage, Sir J. Fraser Stoddart, Bernard L. Feringa, and countless others. Even more recently, these three scientists were the recipients of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry "for the design and synthesis of molecular machines."
<br><br>
It all started in 1983, when Jean-Pierre Sauvage, now a Professor Emeritus at the University of Strasbourg in France, created a new method for synthesizing catenanes which are two or more ring-shaped molecules linked together. His method, the metal template synthesis allowed for much greater yields than before, revolutionizing the production of catenanes, and reviving the field of research. In the process, Sauvage used metal coordination to thread a crescent into another ring, before closing the crescent structure into a ring. As a result, they were able to create quite exotic structures much more easily using their template synthesis. Furthermore, the linking found in a catenane chain created a new type of bond: a mechanical bond. A mechanical bond is physically freer than the covalent bonds that typically join molecules—paving the way for rotational motion, as well as the synthesis of future molecules such as rotaxane.

The next step was made by Sir James Fraser Stoddart, currently a Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern University, when he created the rotaxane in 1991. The rotaxane is a ring-shaped molecule free to move about on a molecular thread—the molecular analog of a wheel and axle. Specifically, Stoddart’s work showed the creation of a molecular shuttle, in which the ring could move left and right along special molecular “stations” on the thread. Although simple in its design, Stoddart’s research paved the way for the creation of molecular machines, as by changing the types of stations, Stoddart’s team envisioned that as it becomes “possible to control the movement of one molecular component with respect to the other in rotaxane, the technology for building "molecular machines" will emerge.”

The final step came in 1999, when Bernard L. Feringa, a professor in Organic Chemistry at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, created the first example of controlled unidirectional rotation—a necessary feature to any rotational motor. At the time, he used UV light to drive two rotors, and used the structural geometry of the locked, double bond in the molecule to prevent backwards rotation. In this process, known as photochemical E-Z isomerization, UV light provides the necessary energy for one rotor to rotate 180o, transitioning into a state of high tension. The tension is then relieved when the energy’s light provides the necessary energy to move the opposite rotor, in the opposite direction, relieving the tension, and restoring the molecule back to its original state. Feringa later devised an even more promising method of rotary, unidirectional motion using chemical energy in 2005. Of course, with the successful demonstration of a molecular motor, the path to new technology was complete.

Now, the field of nanotechnology has expanded enormously, all due to the profound innovations of these three scientists. Molecular switches have been created out of rotaxane, Molecular pumps have also been made out of rotaxane-like structures, and of course, nanocars have been created by Feringa and others, such as James Tour, of Northwestern University. The first nanocar race has even been scheduled for 2017 in Toulouse, France, featuring 6 teams in total, all with their own unique design. With these molecular machines finally finding applications, the future looks quite promising. Perhaps, one day, we’ll be able to look back, and trace the development of nanotechnology, like we can now with the impact of the electric motor. Until then, as Feynman duly noted: “there’s plenty of room at the bottom” for more innovation.
