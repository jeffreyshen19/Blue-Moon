Dendritic cells (DC) are antigen-presenting cells (APC) that are crucial for the initiation of the immune response. A DC has three roles in its life cycle - the sentinel role, the migratory role, and the adjuvant and activation role. During the sentinel role, the immature DC surveys the surroundings for pathogens. When the cell recognizes an antigen, it matures, uptakes and processes an antigen, and then uses a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to present the antigen on the cell surface. Subsequently, during the migratory phase, the mature DC moves through the bloodstream to T-cell rich areas, such as the lymph nodes. During the adjuvant and activation role, the T-cell recognizes the antigen that is presented by the mature DC. This causes the T-cell to activate and proliferate, initiating an immune response. Although various impairments to the migratory role have been recognized, much of this role is currently unknown.

A detailed motor complex composed of actin filaments, myosin motor proteins, and actin regulatory proteins assists in DC migration. Known proteins include hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein 1 (HS1), fascin, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP), and a protein complex Arp2/3, though their specific interactions with each other have yet to be clarified (1-3).
<br>
<br>
Significantly, fascin is an actin filament bundling protein that forms bundles around membrane protrusions caused by actin congregation to assist motility (Figure 1) (4). An absence of fascin can result in reduced migration of DCs to their destinations (5). Similarly, when there is an absence of WASP, a protein essential to actin polymerization, DCs exhibit severely limited movement to T-cell rich areas during their migratory roles, causing reduction in T-cell activation and low initiation of the immune response (Figure 1) (6, 7).
<br>
<br>
While deficiency of actin regulatory proteins like fascin and WASP have been shown to cause autoimmune diseases, such as Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome, severe congenital neutropenia, and X-linked thrombocytopenia (8). These relevant autoimmune diseases, however, although severe and result in extremely shortened life expectancy, usually affect very little portions of the population (9). On the other hand, DCs are believed to play a central role in the immune system’s potential to eliminate neoplastic cells, commonly known as tumor cells, as malignant tumor still takes 7.6 million lives per year (10).
<br>
<br>
The ability of the immune system to combat tumor growth has been evidenced by the occasional spontaneous remissions of renal cell carcinomas and melanomas (11, 12, 13). While these documented cases are clinical and unpredictable, a study of paraneoplastic neurological disorders discovered onconeural Ags, a group of tumor-targeting antibodies, in this case specifically linked to breast and ovarian cancer (14).
<br>

Analysis of DC distribution in breast carcinoma tumor tissues reveals two defining characters: the concentration of immature DCs in tumor bed while the mature DCs are confined to peritumoral areas (15). DC’s unique ability to initiate primary immune responses makes it invaluable to vaccination protocols in cancer, while the aforementioned locational distinction requires for the targeted enhancement of DC motility in tumorous areas (12, 16, 17).
<br>
<br>
DCs loaded with tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) have already shown the ability to induce protective/rejection-immune responses in animal models and promising preliminary data in human; however, current research is looking for ways to mobilize endogenous DCs to perform the same function (18). In the next few years, the current clinical trials with ex vivo–generated DCs will undoubtedly unveil important information of DCs’ quality as vectors of immunotherapy. Ultimately, enhanced DC motility is expected to be combined with viral vectors with ligands of interest that incorporate oncoantibodies and can either bind nonspecifically or specifically to targeted DCs.
