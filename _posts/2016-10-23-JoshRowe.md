Josh Rowe studied Chemistry at Purdue University. While there he spent a summer performing immunoassays for insulin and insulin-like growth factor II for Eli Lilly and Co. It was there he developed an interest in analytical chemistry. After he graduated, he took a job with an agricultural chemical company now called Dow Agrosciences. He used gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments to find and measure trace levels of pesticides in food. After two years he left to work in the pharmaceutical industry. He worked at Eli Lilly for 5 years, and has now been with Allergan for 15 years and is now the head of the analytical chemistry. Throughout this time he has been focused on pharmacokinetics, the use of mass spectrometry to track the biological fate of foreign chemicals, and has helped discover and develop new medicines.<br><br>**Why did you become a scientist?**<br>
It seemed like such a basic and truthful field, you are trying to gain knowledge. It isn’t subjective. I mean it is how the world works. What more important thing can you work on?
<br><br>
**What is your favorite aspect of your work?**<br>
This has changed over time. When I first started, I liked working on state of the art instruments. Now I enjoy working with different people and being able to help them.
<br><br>
**What has been your greatest failure and what have you learned?**<br>
I set out to master biotransformation and mass spectrometer interpretation. In my view I have only learned a fraction of what I could have, I haven’t even nearly mastered it. I have learned how important it is to be a true expert and how to know you know something.
<br><br>
**What does being a scientist mean to you?**<br>
It is a source of a lot of pride. It is the search for truth and knowledge. What else is there?
<br><br>
**What has been the biggest change you have witnessed in your field of science?**<br>
When I first started Mass Spectrometry was fairly basic. It was very hands on work. Now it has changed so much that the skill set needed is very different. It is all about software. These days this is where all the leaps and bounds are being made. It used to be about building and now is about programming and software.
<br><br>
**What problem would you most like to see solved by science in the next 10 years?**<br>
I would like to see the advent of personal medicine. Being able to see a patient and in a short amount of time know what drugs they need would be great.
<br><br>
**How do you define success?**<br>
I actually think that this is a really important question. You have to think very hard about it and it has to come from within. If success is determined externally then you’ll never feel truly satisfied. For me it is doing what you want to do and what you feel is valuable.
<br><br>
**What one discovery in science do you most admire and why?**<br>
I’d have to say the fact that dry eye is an immune disease. Experts in the field long suspected this, and so a colleague of mine did a really elegant experiment to prove it. He first created a model of dry eye in mice (he used a fan in a low humidity environment to give a set of mice dry eye) then he isolated antibodies from either healthy mice or mice with dry eye and injected them into nude mice (a special breed of mice that has a compromised immune system). The nude mice that were injected with antibodies from dry eye mice developed dry eye! The best science isn’t always finding something new, it is proving it.
<br><br>
**If you could go back in time what advice would you give your high school self?**<br>
I spent a long time worrying what field to go into. It is really interesting what motivates people and it is not always pretty. Try to find the positive things to motivate you instead of just trying to prove you worth to other people. It is a more joyful and better way of living. I think that science is a great career choice, but it is a lot of hard work so you have got to love it.
<br><br>
**What would you say are the top three skills needed to be a successful scientist?**<br>
* The ability to become true expert in at least one field
* Persistence
* A deep childlike curiosity
<br>

**What question did I not ask you that you want to answer and share with the readers?**<br>
Going to school and learning science is incredibly different to being a scientist. It also takes time for the knowledge you accumulate to become useful. I also wanted to let the readers know that there is no scientist stereotype. I have met all sorts of different people and personalities who are scientists.
