Recently, researchers at the University of Oxford have demonstrated laser-driven two-qubit and single-qubit logic gates with accuracies above 99.9%, which are both significantly above the approximately 99% minimum accuracy threshold required for fault-tolerant quantum computation.
<br>
<br>
But before we delve into their research, let's just to refresh our knowledge on (quantum computers)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_IaVepNDT4]â€¦
<br>
<br>
In a classical computer (i.e. whatever device you are reading this on right now), information is stored in classical bits, which are either 0 or 1.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, in a quantum computer, a quantum bit (qubit), can be in a quantum superposition of both states, that is 0 and 1 at the same time. This qubit can be created from a variety of tiny particles, such as a photon, a nucleus, or even an electron, as Derek explains in the video. In addition, every electron behaves like a tiny magnetic field, which is characterized by its spin. Thus, in a stronger magnetic field, the poles of the electron will align with the stronger magnetic field.
<br>
<br>
Let us denote this state of aligning with the magnetic field the zero-state, for it requires the least amount of energy (in addition, the spin is down).
<br>
<br>
Changing the spin state to up, however, requires energy, and when the spin state is up, the electron is also at its highest energy state. Let's call this the one-state.
<br>
<br>
However, as a consequence of interactions of sub-atomic particles outlined in Schrodinger's equation, and made famous by Schrodinger's cat, particles can actually be in two states at the same time, just like how the cat can be both dead or alive. This is known as quantum superposition. In this case, the probability of finding the electron in spin up or spin down is given in terms of coefficients of spin up and spin down. Still, the end, observed result of two interacting qubits will be either 00, 01, 10, or 11, just like the classical bit.
<br>
<br>
So, then what makes the two bits different? Here's where things get interesting: In classical bits, the observed result is uniquely determined by the value of the two bits that begin. On the other hand, in qubits, the observed result is actually determined by combining the two coefficients for each possible state in each individual qubit, for a total of 4 coefficients for each possible state of the two combined qubits that yield 2 qubits.
<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, for another additional qubit with 2 different coefficients, there are 8 (2 x 4)  possible coefficients to generate a 3 bit output. More generally, the amount of equivalent classical information stored in n qubits is 2n, which is huge, for even say a couple hundred qubits.
<br>
<br>
Still, the setback here is that once measured, all of the preceding information is lost, including all of the coefficients.
