Often, “research” is thought of as something scary. It’s for other people, the experts: professors, PHD students, or really, really talented undergrads. In part, I’d say this is due to the projections of the media. For example, take the very popular and vaguely disturbing science-y cartoon “Rick and Morty.” It’s about a brilliant, totally immoral, and definitely crazy scientist Rick who takes his entirely average grandson Morty on adventures. The message many young people receive from this admittedly wonderful show is that real science, the research stuff, is for smarter, older people (the Ricks of the world). We’re just Morty’s. 
<br>
<br>
But this is terrible! So much of what we have today was invented by talented, driven young people. Take Gauss, Newton, or Mozart! And there’s still so much left to discover – in mathematics alone, there’s the Riemann hypothesis, etc. Of course, lots of young people are going to feel daunted and underqualified to study such huge problems, and sadly they might be right; you do need a lot of background knowledge for these famous problems. 
<br>
<br>
But there are other sorts of research opportunities available that are definitely intellectually accessible for even high school students! Take for example the astronomical research done at our very own Phillips Academy. 
<br>
<br>
One area which astronomy research students studied last year was that of variable stars. Variable stars are stars which have changing brightnesses. There are different types, with the broadest categorization being intrinsic versus extrinsic. Intrinsic variables generally change their brightness because of their internal core thermostat; moderated by the Ideal Gas Law, the stars fluctuate between different pressures, sizes, and therefore luminosities. Extrinsic variables are sometimes eclipsing binaries; in less technical terms, many extrinsic variables orbit a partner star, which causes the observer to detect changes in brightness when one passes in front of the other. 
<br>
<br>
The astronomy research students were interested in the graphs of luminosity versus time because of all the stellar information they provide (more on that later). But before they could generate graphs, they had to actually determine which specks in the sky were actually variable stars. To identify potential variable stars, students began by running a set of images (sometimes taken on the professional telescope housed in the Gelb observatory) through an application called MPO Canopus’s Variable Star Search. 
<br>
<br>
Having selected objects which produced the characteristic curvy plot (as shown below), students would then take more images of their target. Then they would process their images with another aspect of MPO Canopus, which would then spit out a graph of luminosity (colloquially called a light curve) by using a process called spectroscopic photometry.

<br>
From these light curves, students could assess magnitude, amplitude, and most importantly, period of luminosity. Once a satisfactory light curve was completed, students submitted their findings to the Variable Star Index. The form requires the different names for the star, the light curve data, and the type of variable of the star. For example, one of the below stars is extrinsic and one is intrinsic. This brings us to, in my opinion, the most interesting part of the process: what you can tell from the graphs.

For one, you can tell whether a variable is intrinsic or extrinsic from its graph; the extrinsic ones have a rounder, more sinusoidal plot, whereas the intrinsic ones are much sharper. But there’s more. Using another program called Binary Maker, students can analyze the actual composition of the stars from their images and graphs. Just think about that for a moment; using just a camera and telescope, we can figure out so much about things millions of light years away.
<br>
<br>
So be motivated. Just because you’re young doesn’t mean that there aren’t tons of things you can explore. At PA alone, there’s the astronomy research class described above and a biology research class as well. Both present their findings at a yearly science symposium, which is an excellent opportunity to find out about what sorts of things you can do! For non-Andover opportunities, there are lots of labs which take undergrads and a few which accept high-schoolers. Professors generally work in pretty much the same way. The consensus among high-level undergrads and grad students who’ve gotten research opportunities is that the best way to get in contact with the right people is just cold-calling. Send some emails, and don’t get discouraged if you don’t get replies. Send some more! And network. There are lots of conventions in the Boston area; go to them and shake lots of hands.
<br>
<br>
To add on to my initial statement, research isn’t what’s scary. It’s the idea of research. Contacting famous professors or even just walking into a research class might be pretty daunting. You might ask yourself, “What am I doing here? How am I qualified?” But just remind yourself that young people have accomplished so much. Look at Gauss, at Newton, at Mozart. Don’t sell yourself short. Explore. Learn. Enjoy.
