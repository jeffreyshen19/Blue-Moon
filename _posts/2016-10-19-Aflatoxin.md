“End all forms of malnutrition in 2030.” This is the task world leaders expect the global community to accomplish. Even in 2015, when the world’s new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were affirmed by the UN, it was considered to be an intimidating challenge. One in three people suffer from malnutrition, and there are numerous factors that need to be addressed to improve this situation such as infrastructure deficiencies, women empowerment, and the lack of health care and education (International Food Policy Research Institute, 2016). Today, many developing nations suffer from the “cycle of poverty,” where poverty is both a cause and consequence of malnutrition. Although this challenge to end malnutrition is an immense and daunting task, significant steps can be taken when addressing small, but essential issues.
<br>
<br>
One such issue is aflatoxin contamination. Aflatoxin is a naturally-occurring, colorless, odorless mycotoxin (toxic fungus) which makes it difficult to detect, and renders major crops unusable when contaminated. It is labeled as a Class I human carcinogen, and acute exposure to aflatoxin is lethal, while chronic exposure is widely associated with stunted growth and immunosuppression. Although the correlations between the mycotoxin and stunted growth are still not fully understood, recent research proposes that aflatoxin changes the consumer’s metabolism to reduce nutrient absorption (Jones et al., 2015).
<br>
<br>
Aflatoxin contamination is a global issue, affecting nations in West Africa, Asia, and even the United States. This essay, however, will focus on aflatoxin’s specific impact on Malawi, a small nation in southern Africa, to highlight its importance in a more focused manner.
<br>
<br>
More than half (52.4%) of the Malawian population lives below the poverty line and 22.4% are “barely surviving” (UNIDO Evaluation Group, 2012). Multiple food crises due to severe dry spells have led Malawi to declare a state of national disaster (Oneko, 2016), even though agriculture accounts for 80% of the labor force, one third of the nation’s GDP, and 90% of export revenues (National Statistical Office and ICF Macro, 2011).
<br>
<br>
Stunting in Malawi affects 42.4% of the population, the twelfth highest prevalence in the world (International Food Policy Research Institute, 2016). Hence, stunting is a major indicator for undernutrition.
<br>
<br>
Undernutrition during the “window of opportunity” of the first two years or 1,000 days of life leads to major health disadvantages in later adult years – not only stunting, but impaired cognitive development and intellectual capacity, and reduced lean body mass. Poor educational performance and attendance in the future leads to restricted income-earning potential. A reduced body mass limits productivity in the heavy farming-dependent economy (Unite for Sight, 2015). Child mortality associated with undernutrition has reduced Malawi’s workforce by 10.7%, and a reported US $67 million is annually lost because of limited productivity and reduced workforce (World Food Programme, United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, and African Union Commission). Nutritional intervention is critical as every single day that Malawians are exposed to this toxic substance, aflatoxin continues to bar their access to adequate nutrition.
<br>
<br>
Aflatoxin targets major crops, including maize and groundnuts, and Malawi is the second highest maize consuming country in the world. (Ranum et al., 2014). This maize-centered diet is demonstrated in Malawi’s staple food, nsima, which is made of a thick paste of ground maize flour (FAO, 2010).
<br>
<br>
In addition to maize’s essential role in Malawian lives, groundnuts are a significant component to Malawi’s economy. Up to 25% of all market samples are contaminated well above the international CODEX safety levels, and aflatoxin is repeatedly cited for the collapse of the groundnut trade. The loss in Malawian groundnut export revenue is estimated to reach nearly US $11 million in the year 2017 (Rios, 2013).
<br>
<br>
Aflatoxin has an undeniable impact on Malawi’s crops and population. Addressing aflatoxin control to improve nutrition requires the following actions:
<br>
<br>
1. *Establish ownership and commitment at the top levels*. Steps to address aflatoxins begin with firm commitment at the top. Implementation needs to be frequently monitored and prioritized, and strong relationships need to be built with the people and organizations. (UNIDO Evaluation Group, 2012). International organizations such as USAID and UNIDO can partner with local organizations to establish this.

2. *Strengthen standards and policy framework for aflatoxin screening*. Quality standards and clear systematic processes need to be embedded into aflatoxin regulations for strong enforcement. Strict guidelines, formal processes, and regulatory oversight need to go hand-in-hand with strong commitment to provide the foundation for further initiatives.

3. *Increase awareness and provide training to local farmers on appropriate pre- and post-harvest agricultural practices and storage methods*. National media campaigns can highlight the importance of combating aflatoxin contamination as a communal effort (UNIDO Evaluation Group, 2012). Training for farmers, supplied by local NGOs and programs, will be able to implement efficient methods and policies to increase productivity and reduce post-harvest losses. A rewards system could also be established to incentivize farmers (Rios, 2013).

These steps require cooperation at the local, national and international levels. Processes need to be standard and efficient, and communication at all levels needs to be clear. Aflatoxin contamination is a relevant issue worldwide, and will be a major step in the fight against malnutrition. Solving aflatoxin contamination will lead us closer to reaching that daunting 2030 goal and create a better world for everyone.
