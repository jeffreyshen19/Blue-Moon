The public math educational system in America is terrible. We’re ranked 36th out of 65 developed countries in standardized testing. As Scientific America says, there’s obviously something wrong with the “approach to the subject” that we’re teaching our kids, and this article aims to explain what exactly it is and how we can hopefully fix it.
<br><br>
Take an average kid, Bob, at an average high school. He probably sits through 45-75 minute classes, where he’s either being lectured at or working in some sort of group. Then he’s assigned some homework, the bell rings, and he goes on with his day. Later that night, having had a fully exhausting day, Bob sits down with his math homework. Perhaps he does each problem, diligently and thoughtfully. But I’d wager that the amount of students who are this committed and persistent, given their current educational environments and extracurriculars, is pretty small. So, since we’re saying that Bob’s an average sort of kid, perhaps he tries his homework, gets stuck on a question, decides he doesn’t feel like spending tons of time on it because his teacher will just go over it in class anyway, shuts his book, and moves on. Or maybe (and let’s be honest, we’ve all done it) there’s the scenario where he takes one look at his math homework, decides struggling with the concepts is too difficult, and goes to bed.
<br><br>
So the next day Bob shows up to class. His teacher explains the couple (or ton) of problems he didn’t understand. Maybe said teacher communicates the concepts well, or maybe she/he doesn’t. Either way, the information isn’t going to stick in Bob’s head. He’s being lectured at, sitting passively and trying to absorb information. He’s probably tired, distracted, or bored to some degree. The best case here is that Bob remembers the big concepts for at least a little bit, but at some point (probably very soon) he’s going to forget. For example, how many of you, my dear readers, can recall the formula for the area of an ellipse from your Geometry days? Thought so.
<br><br>
This learning system isn’t ideal. What’s the root of the issue? Moreover, what can we do to solve it?
<br><br>
Problems. Actually doing math problems. What our pre-collegiate educational institutions so obviously lack is an emphasis on problem-solving. As education.com says, “problem solving is fundamental.” Homework has always been secondary to what’s going on in the classroom. Sometimes, it’s assigned as an afterthought, sometimes it’s busy work, and there are even some schools that value it so little in comparison to the other needs of a child that they’ve abolished it. And homework is what contains the few actual hands-on opportunities to dig in the dirt of mathematics that a class has to offer. I acknowledge the constraints of homework. Kids are busy, kids are tired, and kids need sleep. So I propose that we reverse the classroom. While kids are fresh and in the learning mindset of school-time, they should do their problems. Class time should be spent having students either work individually (or in small groups) with their questions. That way, our Bob could grapple with concepts, actively engage with them, and master them. He should be problem-solving, which, in the words of The University of Georgia’s Jim Wilson, includes “doing word problems, creating patterns, interpreting figures, developing geometric constructions, proving theorems, etc.” Having personally figured out the way to go, instead of hearing it from a teacher or classmate in a large group dying to finish early, he’d be ever so much more inclined to remember it. Teachers would act as resources, giving hints about problem-solving strategies, but not detracting from the students’ growth opportunities by explicitly showing them how to solve questions. Homework would be the passive stuff, listening to recorded lectures or reading the textbook to gain a rudimentary grasp of what they’ll be doing in class the next day.

I am not an educational expert. I’m a high school junior (or upper, if you speak Andover). The only knowledge of pedagogy that I have comes from attending programs rooted in problem-solving and having conversations with instructors (albeit amazing ones). But others, far more qualified than I am, agree; for example, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has stated that “Problem solving [must] be the focus of school mathematics. ” Thus, I firmly believe that with this engaging, problem-oriented system, our kids would not only pick up mathematics a lot more quickly, they’d retain it and appreciate it, too.
